## Beware of unknown unknowns

### Observability

Being able to ask arbitrary questions about your environment without having
to know ahead of time what you wanted to ask.

arbitrary is a strong word, so in practice we will settle for sufficiently observable
to enable use to deliver the level of service we promised to our users.
Our application is suï¬€iciently observable if we can triage the issue from the
breadcrumbs of information he has provided us.

To build an observable system we need:

- instrument our application to collect high-quality telemetry data;
- access to tools and systems to efficiently slice, dice and manipulate the data
  to find answers.

### Logging

Common type of telemetry data.

Loglevels:

- trace: lowest level -> extremely verbose and have a low signal-to-noise ratio, etc TCP packet
- debug
- info
- warn
- error: report serious failures that might have user impact

`log::error!("Failed to execute query: {:?}", e)` notice the `{:?}` <- displays more raw view

When dealing with multiple request we need a way to correlate all logs related to the same request.
This is usually achieved using a request id aka correlation id

### Structured Logging

Ensure that request_id is included in all log records. Logs are the wrong abstraction for these
tree like processing pipleline.

## Tracing

tracing expands upon logging-style diagnostics

`subscriber_email = %form.email,` -> % means to use display implementation
